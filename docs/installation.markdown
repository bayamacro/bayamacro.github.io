# How to Install

1. Get the latest version of the macros from:
    [Elden Ring Releases](https://github.com/bayamacro/Baya-Macro-Elden-Ring-Edition/releases)  
    
    **IMPORTANT**: It's highly recommended you all update to the latest version.
  
2. It is reccommended but not needed, to create a folder to store the macro.

# Enable Discord Commands

1. To allow discord commands, you must first run the Baya's Macro exe file.

2. Once ran, a file called 'discord.env' should be in the current working directory.

3. Right click and Edit in Notepad.

2. Edit the value discord_Token by editing the values inside the single quotation marks ` `. 

Do not delete any lines or write stuff in non-designated places.
An Example of how the 'discord.env' file should look: 
    discord_Token = 'MYTOKENHERE'
